## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>= 12.0.0)
- MongoDB
- Cloudinary account (for file uploads)
- VNPay merchant account (for payment processing)
- SMTP Email Service (Gmail recommended for email verification and password reset)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/duongduyy004/eng-center-management.git
   cd English-center-management
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**

### Default Admin Account
The system automatically creates a default admin account on first run:
- **Email**: admin@gmail.com (configurable)
- **Password**: admin123 (configurable)

### Authentication Features

#### Email Verification
- **New User Registration**: All new users must verify their email address
- **Verification Process**: 
  1. User registers with email and password
  2. System sends verification email with secure token
  3. User clicks verification link to activate account
  4. Account becomes active and user can log in

#### Forgot Password with OTP
- **Secure Password Reset**: Uses One-Time Password (OTP) for enhanced security
- **Reset Process**:
  1. User requests password reset with email address
  2. System validates email exists in database
  3. 6-digit OTP generated and sent to user's email
  4. OTP expires after 10 minutes for security
  5. User enters OTP and new password to complete reset
  6. Old OTPs are automatically invalidated

## üìä Business Logic
